'''
The Harris Corner algorithm struggles with circular shapes because circles have smooth, continuous edges without sharp changes in orthogonal directions. 
It relies on strong, abrupt intensity variations in two directions, which are absent in circular or irregular shapes.


Harris Corner Detection is happiest with the pepperoni pizza! 
The round pizza with pepperoni provides more distinct corners due to the sharp intensity changes around the edges of the pepperoni slices and their contrast with the pizza base. In contrast, the slice of cake has fewer distinct corners, as its surface and toppings are often smoother or lack the high contrast and sharp intensity variations needed for robust corner detection.
